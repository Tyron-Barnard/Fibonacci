# Fibonacci Sequence Generator

This Python script generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified positive integer. It demonstrates the calculation of the Fibonacci sequence using recursion.

## Usage

1. Open the Python script file `Fibonnaci.py` in your preferred Python environment.

2. Run the script.

3. You will be prompted to enter a positive integer.

4. The script will calculate and display the Fibonacci sequence up to the entered number.

## Code Explanation

The `fibonacci_sequence` function calculates the Fibonacci sequence using recursion. It takes an integer `n` as an argument and returns the `n`-th term of the Fibonacci sequence.

The script takes input from the user, representing the positive integer up to which the Fibonacci sequence will be generated.

If the input is valid (greater than or equal to 0), the script prints the Fibonacci sequence up to the entered number using a loop.

## Example

If you enter the positive integer `10`, the output will be:

Enter a positive integer: 10
Fibonacci sequence:

5
8
